# Pokedex
Text based Pokédex in Java
Base functionality of the dex includes the following:
- Selection of a Pokédex search type:
  - Stats
  - Regular
  - Random
- Search for Pokémon "Base Stat Values" through integers
- Search for specific Pokémon through strings, and selecting a random pokemon from the text file
- After each search the Pokédex will prompt the user to continue making queries based on the previous type of search

#### notes
- please provide instructions for how a user can run this application
  either from an IDE like IntelliJ or from the commandline
- import the [java-code-style.xml](./java-code-style.xml) into your IntelliJ settings to get
  automatic linting when you press `⌘ + ⌥ + l` in one of your files
- added the .gitignore file to remove things from your repo that will not be consistent for each person that clones it
 
#### bugs 
- when I typed in `y` or `n` for the prompt meant to continue or end the program the expected behavior did not happen
