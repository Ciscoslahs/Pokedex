Description
The Pokedex project includes a Java Pokedex and a Python Pokedex that run through the console. These programs take user input, search through a text file to see if the input matches anything in the file, and then respond with the correct lines from the text file.

Installation
Users do not need to install this project if they have Python or Java capabilities. They can download it directly from the repository.

Usage
To use the Pokedex, simply run either the Java or Python program through the console. The program will prompt you to enter a search query, and it will then search through the text file to find matching entries. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the Pokedex.
