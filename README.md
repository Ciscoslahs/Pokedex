# Pokedex
Text based Pokédex in Java
Base functionality of the dex includes: Choosing a Pokédex type (Stats, Regular, or Random) looking for pokemon "Base Stat Values" through integers, 
looking for specific pokemon through strings, and selecting a random pokemon from the text file. The Pokédex will ask if you want to keep going with 
whatever sort of searching you went with.
